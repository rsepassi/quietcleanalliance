    <h1>Welcome to the Quiet Clean Alliance</h1>
    <p>
    We are a network of independent campaigns across the U.S. working to
    eliminate gas leaf blowers from our communities due to their considerable
    health and environmental harms. Our goal is to accelerate the shift away
    from gas leaf blowers at local, state, and national levels.

    Here is a brief description of what we do. We invite you to visit our other
    pages to learn more about the Quiet Clean Alliance. Be sure to explore our

    <h2>Our Activities</h2>
    <h3>Local</h3>
    <p>
    We work cooperatively to accelerate the shift off gas leaf blowers and
    other gas-powered land care tools in each of our municipalities and
    counties.
    </p>
    <h3>State</h3>
    <p>
    We track active bills in state legislatures that support the reduction or
    elimination of gas land care equipment. We act together to support and
    defend policy efforts in each of our states.
    </p>
    <h3>National</h3>
    <p>
    We advocate to restore the Federal Noise Control Office and for action by
    Congress and federal agencies to eliminate gas leaf blowers and other
    gas-powered land care equipment.
