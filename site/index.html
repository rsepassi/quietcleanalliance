  <p>
  The Quiet Clean Alliance (QCA) is a network of independent campaigns across the U.S. working to eliminate gas leaf blowers from our communities due to their considerable health and environmental harms. Our goal is to accelerate the shift away from gas leaf blowers and other gas-powered landscape equipment at local, state, and national levels.

   <h3>Our Activities</h3>

<p>QCA members share information and provide mutual support. By joining together in alliance with our supporting organizations, we build political strength at every level.
