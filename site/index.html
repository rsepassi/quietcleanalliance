  <p>
  The Quiet Clean Alliance (QCA) is a network of independent campaigns across the U.S. working to eliminate gas leaf blowers from our communities due to their considerable health and environmental harms. Our goal is to accelerate the shift away from gas leaf blowers and other gas-powered landscape equipment at local, state, and national levels.

  Here is a brief description of what we do. We invite you to visit our other pages to learn more about the Alliance.

  We track active bills in state legislatures that support the reduction or
  elimination of gas-powered landscape equipment. Members jointly support and
  defend policy efforts in our respective states.
